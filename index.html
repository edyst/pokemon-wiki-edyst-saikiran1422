                    We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
                    Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
                    evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of
                    generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either
                    way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.

                    Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
                    progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon
                    who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the
                    point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot
